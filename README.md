# Streaky

A Django-based web application to let you maintain a streak of your personal goal, to keep you going!

## Features

-   Streak tracking
-   User authentication _(login, signup, logout etc.)_
-   Persistent data
-   Simple UI/UX

## How to run locally:

I made this app just to practice django and web-dev more generally. It is not hosted, so you need to run/use it locally on your machine.

I've written a simple python script a while ago, which will automatically run the project in your default browser.

To setup the project on your machine, follow these steps below.

-   Install latest stable version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
-   Download this repository.
-   Extract the zip and open terminal in the `streaky-webapp-main` folder.
-   Create a virtual environment and activate it. **(Optional but Recommended)**
-   `cd` into `streaky` folder. (e.g `cd streaky`)
-   Run `python run_project.py` command. _(This will install dependencies, run the development server and then launch this app in your default default web browser.)_

## Technologies used

### Frontend:

-   **HTML5:** Structuring the web pages (django templates)
-   **CSS3:** Styling and layout of the app
-   **Javascript:** Adding interactivity and client-side functionality.
